# what is dockistry?
Dockistry is a [registry](https://labs.stackfork.com:2003/explore/projects/starred) containing many neat-o [docker](https://docker.com) stacks, boiler-plates, and devtools packages which are organized in [categories](https://labs.stackfork.com:2003/explore/groups) each serving a purpose i.e.- (blog, e-commerce, admin-panel, etc).  

Dockistry comes with a [mutli-platform app](https://github.com/forktheweb/dockistry/blob/master/roadmap.md), which helps you install [devtools](https://github.com/dockistry/devtools-multi-clis) on Linux/ Mac/ Windows desktops, and various [production stacks](https://labs.stackfork.com:2003/groups/servers) or [infrastructure packages](https://github.com/forktheweb/dockistry/blob/master/docs-infrastructure-packages.md) on Docker servers at Amazon AWS and Google Cloud.

## for novice developers
Dockistry installs and configures everything you will need to build apps:

- Hosting infrastructure for docker containers and websites
- Local test environments based on our expert strategy engine
- Boilerplates and other tools 

It helps you make sense of the chaos, and gives you perspective on what is out there.

## for seasoned developers
Dockistry allows you to "shop" for the perfect fullstack strategy by providing:

- Pre-built containers and tools that are installed via our [multi-platform app](https://github.com/forktheweb/dockistry/blob/master/roadmap.md), written in Go
- Comprehensive, unit-tested [developer tooling packages](https://github.com/dockistry/devtools-multi-clis)
- Support for your favorite package managers and languages
- Expertly crafted environments on AWS and Google clouds for production deploys
- Automatic Horizontal Scalability built-in
- Built for End-to-End (E2E) solutions
- Desktop, mobile, and website apps from a ***single*** code base (i.e.- true E2E)
- Continuous Delivery & Integration options available
- Devops tooling to make your life easy when managing clusters of servers

## what is a fullstack strategy? 
Each dockistry strategy contains the following:
   * one [frontend framework](https://github.com/forktheweb/dockistry/blob/master/docs-frameworks.md) 
   * many [languages & dependencies](#)
   * [tooling packages](https://github.com/dockistry/devtools-multi-clis) (for each environment)
   * [infrastructure packages](https://github.com/forktheweb/dockistry/blob/master/docs-infrastructure-packages.md) for setting up a hosting cluster on AWS/Google clouds
   * one or more [databases](https://github.com/forktheweb/dockistry/blob/master/docs-database.md)
   * an API or other [components](https://github.com/forktheweb/dockistry/blob/master/docs-componentry.md) to work with the database
   * various utilities (possibly many) 

## let's organize!
There are a million fullstack considerations, and we've broken them down into one simplistic format and online git [registry](https://labs.stackfork.com:2003/explore/groups) that's easily cloned.  That registry is what powers our desktop app, which is constantly updated and curated by our fullstack forking pterodactyls.  

They are assembling collections of the best opensource products available Github and building out boilerplates that simplify your setup and give you a roadmap & guide to follow.  Our ultimate goal is to build a fullstack community that embraces any platform/ language/ skill level.  We have a very detailed plan on how to achieve that, but this project is our baseline.
