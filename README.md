# what is dockistry?
Dockistry is a [registry](https://labs.stackfork.com:2003/explore/projects/starred) containing many neat-o [docker](https://docker.com) stacks, boiler-plates, and devtools packages which are organized in [categories](https://labs.stackfork.com:2003/explore/groups) each serving a purpose i.e.- (blog, e-commerce, admin-panel, etc).  

Dockistry comes with a [mutli-platform app](https://github.com/forktheweb/dockistry/blob/master/roadmap.md), which helps you install [devtools](https://github.com/dockistry/devtools-multi-clis) on Linux/ Mac/ Windows desktops, and various [production stacks](https://labs.stackfork.com:2003/groups/servers) or [infrastructure packages](https://github.com/forktheweb/dockistry/blob/master/docs-infrastructure-packages.md) on Docker servers at Amazon AWS and Google Cloud.

## for novice developers
Dockistry installs and configures everything you will need to build apps:

- Hosting infrastructure for docker containers and websites
- Local test environments based on our expert strategy engine
- Boilerplates and other tools 

It helps you make sense of the chaos, and gives you perspective on what is out there.

## for seasoned developers
Dockistry allows you to "shop" for the perfect fullstack strategy by providing:

- Pre-built containers and tools that are installed via our [multi-platform app](https://github.com/forktheweb/dockistry/blob/master/roadmap.md), written in Go
- Comprehensive, unit-tested [developer tooling packages](https://github.com/dockistry/devtools-multi-clis)
- Support for your favorite package managers and languages
- Expertly crafted environments on AWS and Google clouds for production deploys
- Automatic Horizontal Scalability built-in
- Built for End-to-End (E2E) solutions
- Desktop, mobile, and website apps from a ***single*** code base (i.e.- true E2E)
- Continuous Delivery & Integration options available
- Devops tooling to make your life easy when managing clusters of servers

## what is a fullstack strategy? 
Each dockistry strategy contains the following:
   * one [frontend framework](https://github.com/forktheweb/dockistry/blob/master/docs-frameworks.md) 
   * many [languages & dependencies](#)
   * [tooling packages](https://github.com/dockistry/devtools-multi-clis) (for each environment)
   * [infrastructure packages](https://github.com/forktheweb/dockistry/blob/master/docs-infrastructure-packages.md) for setting up a hosting cluster on AWS/Google clouds
   * one or more [databases](https://github.com/forktheweb/dockistry/blob/master/docs-database.md)
   * an API or other [components](https://github.com/forktheweb/dockistry/blob/master/docs-componentry.md) to work with the database

## the first and only fullstack strategy engine
There are a million fullstack considerations, and we've broken them down into one simple format and online  [registry](https://labs.stackfork.com:2003/explore/groups) that's easily cloned.  That registry is what powers our desktop app, and is constantly updated and curated by our fullstack forking pterodactyls.  

They're assembling collections of the best fullstack stuff available on Github and building out boilerplates that simplify your development setup.  

Ultimately Dockistry aims to build a kick-arse fullstack community that embraces any platform, language, and skill level.  We have a very detailed plan on how to achieve that, and this application is part of that.
